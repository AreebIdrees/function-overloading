Aim-To learn Object oriented programming in C++
Title- Function overloading
Theory-Function Overloading is defined as the process of having two or more function with the same name, but different in parameters is known as function overloading in C++. In function overloading, the function is redefined by using either different types of arguments or a different number of arguments. It is only through these differences compiler can differentiate between the functions.

Regulations of Using
Different parameters or three different conditions :

These functions have different parameter type
sum(int a, int b)

sum(double a, double b)

These functions have a different number of parameters
sum(int a, int b)

sum(int a, int b, int c)

These functions have a different sequence of parameters
sum(int a, double b)

sum(double a, int b)
